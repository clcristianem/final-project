# final-project
#tetris but with new and tricky blocks

#I wanted to make new blocks that are tricky to place but also still allow the player to sucessfully get points

#I found it difficult to make a game that still felt like tetris (organizing the blocks together) but with a newer playstyle

#I found it difficult to do anything with the "CROSS" block, it disrupts the flow of the game if the player is given too many of the same "CROSS" block in a row

#Difficulty comes from finding out how to make new blocks without them being too disruptive for the game to function

#Also a side goal or two comes from two things: 

#1. The game ends if the player rotates a block when it first spawns - could be solved by forcing the block to spawn at the top of the play screen

#2. Want to make more blocks to add into the game
