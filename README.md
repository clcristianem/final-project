#CIS 1051 Final Project - TRICKY TETRIS

#tetris but with new and tricky blocks

#I wanted to make new blocks that are tricky to place but also still allow the player to sucessfully get points

#I found it difficult to make a game that still felt like tetris (organizing the blocks together) but with a newer playstyle

#I found it difficult to do anything with the "CROSS" or "+" block, it disrupts the flow of the game if the player is given too many of the same "CROSS" block in a row

#Difficulty comes from finding out how to make new blocks without them being too disruptive for the game to function

#Also a side goal or two comes from two things: 

#1. The game ends if the player rotates a block when it first spawns - could be solved by forcing the block to spawn at the top of the play screen

#2. Want to make more blocks to add into the game


#FINAL COMMENTS
#Enjoyed this final project very much, it taught me that something simple and enjoyable like a game of tetris could be changed with just a few lines of code. 

#It also taught me that everything that goes on in a game isn't as easy, as there is a lot of troubleshooting and problem solving with games.

#Troubleshooting the game required me to play the game multiple times. It was fun at first but constantly disrupted my flow as I would run into errors while playing.
