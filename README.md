# final-project
#tetris but with new and tricky blocks
#I wanted to make new blocks that are tricky to place but also still allow the player to sucessfully get points
#I found it difficult to make a game that still felt like tetris (organizing the blocks together) but with a newer playstyle
#I found it difficult to do anything with the "CROSS" block, it disrupts the flow of the game if the player is given too many of the same "CROSS" block in a row
